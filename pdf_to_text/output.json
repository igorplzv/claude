      "abstract": "The expanding of material library of laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF) is of great significance to the \ndevelopment of material science. In this study, the biomedical Ti-13Nb-13Zr powder was mixed with the tantalum \nparticles (2 wt%−8 wt%) and fabricated by L-PBF. The microstruc ture consists of a β matrix with partially unmelted pure \ntantalum distributed along the boundaries of molten pool owing to the Marangoni convention.  Because the melting process \nof Ta absorbs lots of energy, th e size of molten pool becomes s maller with the increase of Ta content. The fine \nmicrostructure exists in the center of melt pool while coarse m icrostructure is on the bound aries of melt pool because of \nthe existence of heat-affected zone. The columnar-to-equiaxed t ransitions (CETs) happen in the zones near the unmelted \nTa, and the low lattice mismatch induced by solid Ta phase is r esponsible for this phenomenon. The recrystallization \ntexture is strengthened while the fiber texture is weakened whe n the tantalum content is increased. Due to the formation \nof refined martensite α′ grains during L-PBF, the compressive strengths of L-PBF-proce ssed samples are higher than \nthose fabricated by traditional processing technologies. The pr esent research will provide an important reference for \nbiomedical alloy design via L-PBF process in the future. \n \nKey words:  laser powder bed fusion; titani um alloys; tantalum; solidifica tion microstructure; texture evolution \n \nCite this article as:  ZHOU Li-bo, SHU Jing-guo, SUN Jin-shan, CHEN Jian, HE Jian-jun , LI Wei, HUANG Wei-ying, \nNIU Yan, YUAN Tie-chui.

Material density and homogeneity was investigated as a function of laser scan speed andscanning strategy. Dense ( >99.99%), pore free material was obtained at optimised processing parameters\nand a ‘remelt ’scan strategy improved melting of the Ta powders, avoiding keyhole formation.\nTensile and ultrasonic modulus testing of the SLM Ti25Ta revealed that the processed material had a\nsimilar yield strength to SLM commercially pure Ti, namely 426 ±15 MPa, with a signi ﬁcant reduction of\nelastic modulus to 65 ±5 GPa. The remelt scan strategy increased the yield strength to 545 ±9 MPa,\nwithout altering the elastic modulus, however reduced the elongation from 25 ±1t o1 1 ±4%. TEM\nanalysis revealed the microstructure consisted of predominantly hexagonal\na0martensite with a limited\namount of orthorhombic a00martensite formed in the Ta-rich regions near partially melted Ta particles,\nspeci ﬁcally facilitated by enhanced diffusion occurring during the remelt scan. The composition range for\nthea00phase was observed to be approximately 40 e50 wt% Ta. Electron back-scattered imaging (BSI) and\nback scattered diffraction (EBSD) revealed the formation of the prior bgrains with close to equiaxed\nmorphology and a slight texture in the a0martensite. The application of the remelt scan disrupted the\nprior bgrain structure and resulted in randomly oriented a0laths.\nCrown Copyright ©2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "An advantage of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of metals is that one can create topologically complex com-\nponents with comparative ease. Most LPBF studies use commercial pre-alloyed powders and less attention has \nbeen given to new alloy design for LPBF. Physical mixing of powders with different chemistries can be an \neffective way to access new alloy compositions for LPBF without the need for custom pre-alloyed powders. In this \nwork, a previously published model to describe the chemical distribution of LPBF material from mixed powders \nis extended to the process of remelting and is quantitatively compared with experiment. A mix of Ni and stainless \nsteel powders is used to assess the effect of remelting on the chemical homogeneity and the model is shown to \nagree well with experiment once evaporation of selected species and changes in melt pool size during remelting \nare incorporated. Strategies to improve the chemical homogeneity of prints from mixed powders are discussed. \nRemelting is one approach but the chemical homogeneity improves only marginally after three remelts. The \ncritical role of the melt pool size compared to the minority powder particle spacing is emphasised. Finally, an \nexample of using spatially controlled chemical homogeneity to create architectured materials using LPBF is \nshown.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the fatigue performance of additively manufactured Ti25Ta, produced by laser powder bed fusion \n(L-PBF) using pre-mixed powder is investigated. Ti25Ta shows promise as a biomedical implant alloy, due to its \nhigh strength to elastic modulus ratio. However, the fatigue response of L-PBF Ti25Ta is yet unknown and un-\nderstanding fatigue behaviour is crucial for cyclically loaded implants. \nThe Ti25Ta alloy was produced employing single melt and remelt scanning strategies. It was shown that the \nremelt strategy had a positive effect on reducing the amount of remaining partially melted Ta particles from 2.07 \n±0.01 vol % to 0.22 ±0.01 vol % while only slightly increasing the porosity from 0.15 ±0.01 vol % to 0.37 ±\n0.01 vol %. Furthermore, it was found that the remelt strategy resulted in alloy strengthening and a randomised \norientation of the α∕lath microstructure. \nMachined fatigue samples were tested in the low-cycle fatigue regime under strain-controlled conditions. The \nalloy demonstrated a superior yield stress normalised fatigue performance compared with commercially pure \n(CP) Ti, and Ti–6Al–4V ELI, and was second only to pure Ta. However, the Ti25Ta L-PBF material retains less \nthan half the elastic modulus of all the compared materials. The remelt samples showed an increased stress \nresponse due to their higher strength and an increased elastic modulus, however a reduced number of cycles to \nfailure. This was attributed to reduced ductility and increased crack propagation rate. It is believed that remelt \nscan parameter optimisation can further enhance the performance of this alloy.",
