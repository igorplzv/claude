In the present work, Ti65Ta was additively manufactured as a new potential material for Titanium small biomedical implants. Assessment of the effects of a remelt scanning strategy was solely accomplished by Laser powder bed fusion testing of small mechanical specimens. Yield strength was achieved superior to either L-PBF pure Ti or Ta and Fatigue low-cycle fatigue behaviour was similar to that of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4 V. The Ti65Ta alloy is a good candidate for a Biomedical new gold standard alloy for small bone interfacing implants. 1. Introduction resorption and implant failure [8,9]. Furthermore, additively manu- factured Ti-6Al-4 V solidifies in a brittle martensitic α′microstructure in Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, especially powder bed the as-built state, requiring post-heat treatments to reintroduce accept- fusion processes, have gained importance in the aerospace and medical able levels of ductility [10]. The development of new AM biomedical sectors within the last decade, especially in cases where challenging alloys is required to improve both implant mechanical performance and materials have to be processed, leading to high conventional part pro- implant-bone integration. One promising alloy system is the titanium- duction costs [1–3]. Here, the high freedom of design, direct model-to- tantalum (Ti-Ta) system. This alloy falls within the class of β-titanium part production and high dimensional tolerances enabled by the laser alloys, as at contents of over 45 wt% Ta, a β-phase structure is fully based powder bed fusion technique (L-PBF) provide significant retained, lowering the elastic modulus to half that of pure Ti [11]. In manufacturing benefits for bespoke parts. Nickel based superalloy addition, Ta has a long history of use in medicine, building a strong case Inconel718, stainless steel 316L and titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V were for its biocompatibility and has recently been highlighted for its ability originally the focus of AM investigations [4–6], however recent de- to enhance bone growth [12–14]. velopments have expanded the AM material toolkit to Al-alloys, tool The barriers to using Ta containing alloys in biomedical applications steels, Mg- alloys and functional materials in order to open up markets in include the difficulties of manufacture and the inherent high density of numerous industries [7]. Ta. Ta, as a refractory metal, melts at approximately 3000 ◦C, making it For biomedical implants, Ti-6Al-4 V is used almost exclusively due to difficult and expensive to alloy and manufacture into complex shapes its inert, corrosion resistant character and its high strength to weight [15]. Furthermore, the high density of Ta restricts its use for large im- ratio. Nonetheless, Ti-6Al-4 V was originally developed for aircraft and plants as the implant weight is too great, causing stress on surrounding not for biomedical use. In applications where Ti-6Al-4 V is used for tissues and ligaments. But for small implants, such as mandible recon- implants which replace large segments of bone, due to its high elastic struction plates, Ta alloys could provide the benefits of low elastic modulus, stress-shielding can occur around the implant, leading to bone modulus and enhanced bone integration.

An improved match of implant-bone structure helps to improve both the implant stability, by increasing surface interaction between the implant and bone, and the quality of life of the patient, due to better functionality and aesthetic outcomes [16]. However, the qualification of AM parts across multiple industries has raised concerns in correlating the mechanical response of conventional standardised specimen sizes produced by AM to the performance of complex geometry AM parts [18]. As opposed to conventional manu- facture, where both parts and test specimens could be machined from the same bulk material, each AM part has an unique thermal history depending on its geometry [19]. Hence, building conventional dimen- sion mechanical test specimens creates a microstructure with different Fig. 1.

The increase in efits can arise from using small specimen sizes, especially for difficult to strength is attributed to the reduction in grain size, whilst the increase in process metals, such as Ta [15].

State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China © Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021 Abstract: The expanding of material library of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is of great significance to the development of material science. In this study, the biomedical Ti-13Nb-13Zr powder was mixed with the tantalum particles (2 wt%−8 wt%) and fabricated by L-PBF. The microstructure consists of a β matrix with partially unmelted pure tantalum distributed along the boundaries of molten pool owing to the Marangoni convention. Because the melting process of Ta absorbs lots of energy, the size of molten pool becomes smaller with the increase of Ta content. The fine microstructure exists in the center of melt pool while coarse microstructure is on the boundaries of melt pool because of the existence of heat-affected zone. The columnar-to-equiaxed transitions (CETs) happen in the zones near the unmelted Ta, and the low lattice mismatch induced by solid Ta phase is responsible for this phenomenon. The recrystallization texture is strengthened while the fiber texture is weakened when the tantalum content is increased. Due to the formation of refined martensite α′ grains during L-PBF, the compressive strengths of L-PBF-processed samples are higher than those fabricated by traditional processing technologies. The present research will provide an important reference for biomedical alloy design via L-PBF process in the future.

In addition, layer by layer SLM process provides product customization and short time to Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) (commonly market, which are critical for the medical field since termed 3D printing) is resulting in a paradigm they can increase the success rate of the operation change across multiple industries, especially in the and shorten the operation time. For titanium-base biomedical field [1−4]. Fabricating the net-shape parts, not just in biomedicine, SLM printed part can metallic parts with complex geometries which are save 50% of the cost by basically missing out not achievable with conventional processing material loss and exorbitant machining casts [9].

Our previous studies fields of traditional process [10, 11]. have also shown that the L-PBF can successfully Even though the laser powder bed fusion (L- fabricate pure Ta with high relative density. PBF) has many advantages, one of the drawbacks is Therefore, in this paper, the mixtures of tantalum and the limitation of material library which seriously titanium alloy powder (Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy, a restricts the development of this technology [12−14]. promising biomedical material, which has been Fortunately, the capability of L-PBF to process researched in our previous studies [27, 28]) were mixed powder has provided new and effective fabricated by L-PBF.

AZIZI et al [18] investigated the L-PBF- particles present a spherical morphology with a printed Ti-Al-Fe alloy and the results showed that smooth surface. The Ta particles, obtained by globularization and formation of small β grains along hydrogenation-dehydrogenation process, exhibit the building direction occurred because of the irregular shape and a small size compared to presence of Fe. All of these titanium alloys are going Ti-13Nb-13Zr powder, as observed in Figure 1(b). to be used or have been applied in biomedical fields. Four different Ti-13Nb-13Zr/Ta composites However, safety concerns are raised on these alloys containing 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 wt% and 8 wt% Ta were as they contain Fe or Al which can cause some side prepared by ball milling with a planetary ball mill effects on the body [19, 20]. Therefore, the new machine. For the sake of ease, the corresponding L- titanium alloys that do not contain any of these toxic PBF-printed samples are denoted by 2Ta, 4Ta, 6Ta elements should be developed. and 8Ta, respectively. In order to prevent the powder Since the high biocompatibility and corrosion fluidity from being damaged, a series of ball mill resistance, tantalum (Ta) can be act as an excellent exploration techniques have been carried out in our potential material for alloying with titanium alloys team, and the mill process was set as: ball-to-powder for biomedical [21]. What’s more, Ta is a β stabilizer weight ratio (2:1), rotation speed (150 r/min) and for titanium alloy. As we all know, β titanium alloy mill time 3 h. Then the composites powders were displays low modulus compared to the commonly dried in the vacuum at 323 K for 24 h and sieved used alloys which can reduce the adverse effect of stress shielding [22, 23].

During the L-PBF process, the 10 mm×10 mm were fabricated by L-PBF apparatus J. Cent. South Univ. (2021) 28: 1111−1128 1113 2.2 Characterization of microstructure and mechanical properties The phase formation of the samples fabricated by L-PBF was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2250). All tests were carried out on the longitudinal direction, owing to the anisotropy of SLM forming samples. The metallographic samples were prepared through the standard procedures and etched with Kroll’s reagent. The optical microscope (OM), FEI Quanta FEG 250 filed emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD, EDAX TSL) and JEOL 2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to characterize the microstructures of samples. The mixture of 6% perchloric acid, 34% normal butanol and 60% methanol was used to prepare the samples for TEM and EBSD observation with electrolytic polishing at 243 K and 23 V. The element distribution was quantitatively analyzed by the electro-probe microanalyzer (EPMA JXA-8530F). Compressive test was performed using an Instron test 3369 machine, at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min at room temperature. In order to ensure the uniformity of sample testing, all tests including optical, SEM, TEM and EPMA are carried out in the middle part of sample. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase analysis The XRD analysis of Ti-13Nb-13Zr/8Ta mixed powder and L-PBF-printed samples with different Ta Figure 1 SEM images of gas atomized Ti-13Nb-13Zr (a), additions has been conducted and the obtained purity Ta particle (b) and Ti-13Nb-13Zr/Ta composite patterns are shown in Figure 2(a).

South Univ. (2021) 28: 1111−1128 Figure 2(b), becomes significantly broadened and the intensity presents a considerable decrease, which implies that the crystals are refined and the fine microstructure is formed in this instant. The solidification cellular structures of 2Ta, 4Ta, 6Ta and 8Ta samples are shown in Figures 3(a)−(d), respectively. The constitutional super-cooling theory are responsible for the occurrence of cellular structures because of the high-temperature gradient and cooling rate in L-PBF process. For quantitative characterization of the cellular structures, the area- method can be used [21]: A/M s N where A is the area of the SEM image; M is the magnification; N is the number of the cells on the target zone (as shown in Figures 3(a′)−(d′), respectively), which is calculated by the software “ImageJ”. The results turn out that the average grain sizes of 2Ta, 4Ta, 6Ta and 8Ta samples are 0.185, Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns of Ti-13Nb-13Zr/8Ta powder 0.134, 0.112 and 0.071 μm, respectively. The sample and L-PBF-printed samples Ti-13Nb-13Zr, 2Ta, 4Ta, 6Ta 8Ta has the smallest average grain size compared and 8Ta, and details with 2Ta, 4Ta and 6Ta samples, which is consistent with the results of XRD patterns as discussed above. L-PBF process. It is easy to find that the β phase In order to further confirm the phase peaks are shifted to higher 2θ value with the increase composition, the TEM analysis of 2Ta, 4Ta, 6Ta and of the Ta content, as shown in Figure 2(b). According 8Ta samples was carried out and the images are to Bragg’s law [30]: presented in Figures 4(a), (b), (c) and (d), respectively. It is apparent that all L-PBF-printed 2dsinθ=nλ samples present a duplex microstructure and the The increase of the 2θ value implies a decrease martensite phases are distributed within the β matrix. of the lattice plane distance d, which is believed to The bright-TEM images indicate that the β grains be caused by the formation of titanium-tantalum exhibit a lamellar morphology and the hcp phase is solid solution [31]. As the Ta content increases, the α′ martensite because of the needle-like morphology solubilization of Ta will be enhanced. The and fine size, as marked by red arrows [9]. The high- microscopy volume expansion usually occurs in the resolution transmission electron microscopy solid solution, which induces the stress that acts on (HRTEM) and the corresponding Fast Fourier the grain boundaries and may influence the lattice Transform (FFT) image were also conducted on 2Ta parameters [32]. In addition, the residual stress and 8Ta samples to confirm whether orthorhombic α″ which enhances with the increase of Ta content also martensite existed. The results further confirmed that influences the lattice parameters at the grain boundaries [33]. Taking the results of MARI et al the martensitic structure is α′ martensite.

What’s more, with the increase melt pool arising from the heat can be observed in of the residual stress, the solubilization of Ta will the etched surface [28, 35]. The energy density used also be enhanced.

The unmelted melting point. Therefore, many partially melted Ta particles confirmed by the EDX line scanning are tantalum particles can be observed in the optical mainly distributed at the boundaries of the molten images, as marked by red arrows, especially in the pool owing to the Marangoni convention [36, 37]. 1116 J.

The presence of unmelted boundaries of the melt pool and then solidify at the metal Ta in the molten pool will impede the boundaries because of the high cooling rate during movement of liquid fluid and increase the viscosity L-PBF process [38]. In order to identify elemental of melt pool, which result in the occurrence of some concentration, the EMPA mapping was conducted on detrimental phenomena and finally lead to the the samples and the results are shown in Figure 6. reduction of density. Similar phenomena have been The results indicate that the volume fraction of reported by GU et al [33] and ATTAR et al [39].

The average widths of melt pool were compared with traditional technologies, so the finer calculated using the software “ImageJ”. The results microstructure is formed at the center of melt pool. show that the width of melt pool is more than The heat-affected zone (HAZ) exists at the 150 μm in 2Ta sample (Figure 7(a)), while it is boundaries of melt pool and its high temperature will 50 μm in 8Ta sample (Figure 7(d)). induce the grain growth [43]. Besides, the overlap zones of multiple melt pool may have been reheat- 3.3 Microstructure and texture evolution affected several times owing to the unique Figure 8(a) illustrates the SEM images of 2Ta processing method of L-PBF [44], that is why the sample along the building direction, in which the grains in overlap zones are coarser than that in the boundaries of melt pool are visible. Most grains center of melt pool. There is no unmelted Ta in the grow epitaxially across the melt pool boundaries, melt pool zone, the fine grains present a directional which is a typical characteristic of the microstructure growth along the z-axis since the direction of the in L-PBF-printed parts. This can be attributed to the temperature gradient is from the edge of the melt remelting of previous layers and the diffusion pool to its center, as presented in Figures 8(b) phenomenon during L-PBF process [40]. As seen in and (d). the picture, two main kinds of microstructures can be Since the duration of laser irradiation that acts observed in the sample. The average width of grains on the powder is extremely short, the instantaneous is relatively small at the central of molt pool, while temperature is insufficient to melt the Ta powder the microstructure contains coarser grains at the completely, thus leading to a simultaneous presence overlap zones of multiple melt pools and the edge of liquid phase and solid phase in melt pool. The zone of the molt pools, which is magnified in Figure solid Ta phase will act as heterogeneous nucleation 8(c). This can be explained by two reasons: sites because of the low lattice mismatch [5, 17]. according to earlier studies [41, 42], the liquid-solid Therefore, two typical microstructures can be interface velocities and the temperature gradient are observed, namely oriented cellular substructures relatively larger in the melt pool of L-PBF when near the Ta nucleation site and equiaxed 1118 J.

Taking the results of REN et al [46] and For the purpose to investigate the effect of Ta WANG et al [5] into consideration, the columnar-to- content on the texture evolution, the EBSD was equiaxed transitions (CETs) of grains formation have conducted on the building direction of samples 2Ta been related to the temperature gradient G and and 4Ta.

In addition, the through many layers. The fine α′ martensite can be complex heat transfer behavior in the zones near observed within prior β grains. These microstructure unmelted Ta results in the nearly isotropous features are not characteristics of typical distribution of temperature gradient, and thus transformation mechanisms, namely martensite facilitates the formation of cellular substructure in β→α′ transformation which fills parent β grains with these regions [16]. Generally, due to the higher α′ plates. Similar results have been reported in thermal diffusion rate in the region of solid phase, Ref. [17] where a 2 wt% La addition to pure Ti alloy the melts in these regions tend to solidify leads to a similar microstructure. Different from the preferentially along the edge of the pool while Figure 10(a), the columnar grains in sample 4Ta nucleating and growing in typical columnar (Figure 10(d)) are not as clear as those in sample 2Ta, dendrites [47].

It is well-accepted that four nonequilibrium phases, namely,α(cid:48),α(cid:48)(cid:48)andmetastableβphaseexistinTi-Taalloys.Thestructureofα(cid:48),α(cid:48)(cid:48)andβarehexagonal close-packed(HCP),base-centeredorthorhombic(BCO)andbody-centeredcubic(BCC),respectively. X-rayDiffraction(XRD)analysisshowedthattheα(cid:48)phasetransformedtotheα(cid:48)(cid:48)phasewiththeincrease ofenergydensity. Thelamellarα(cid:48)/α(cid:48)(cid:48)phasesandtheα(cid:48)(cid:48)twinsweregeneratedinthepriorβphase. ThemicrostructureandmechanicalpropertiesoftheTi-TaalloywereoptimizedwithdifferentLPBF processingparameters.ThesamplespreparedbyLPBFenergydensityof381J/mm3hadafavorable ultimatestrength(UTS)of1076±2MPaandyieldstrengthof795±16MPa.Thesamplesprepared byLPBFenergydensityof76hadexcellentductility,withanelongationof31%atfracture.

However,theTi-TaalloywithfullymeltedTacanbehardly obtained using LPBF technology due to the small gap between the melting point of Ta (3017◦C)andtheboilingpointofTi(3287◦C).Inaddition,themechanicalpropertiesof Ti-TaalloycanbetailoredbythecontentanddistributionoftheunmeltedTa.

Effect of Processing Parameters on Densification Response surface design was made in Design‐Expert 12 software. According to the ANOVA analysis of variance, the fitting degree R‐square was 0.9718. The effect of P, v and h on relative density (RD) was fitted by a second‐order function, as shown in Equation (1). The Adj R‐square and Pred R‐square were 0.9356 and 0.8537, respectively. Statistical in‐ dexes indicated that the established model could accurately reflect the effect of variables on the response. When the p‐Value of P, v, h was less than 0.05, which indicated that the P, v, h were the most significant factors [34]. RD = 99.16 + 0.775P − 2.77v − 1.21h + 0.725Ph + 0.3vh − 1.35P2 − 3.5v2 − 1.98h2 (1) The relative density map of the LPBF‐built Ti‐Ta alloy with various process parame‐ ters were shown in Figure 3. The curved surfaces were characterized by different degrees of density, with red color indicating high density and blue color indicating low density. The process window displaying different densities was projected at the bottom plane. For a certain h, as shown in Figure 3, with the scanning speed increasing, the relative density increased first and then decreased. The preferred processing window was located around the P for 100 W and v for 1100 mm/s. If h was 0.06 mm, the relative density reached as high as over 99.50% with a power of 90–110 W and speed of 500–1200 mm/s. The highest relative density of the Ti‐Ta alloy reached 99.98% when the P, v, and h were 100 W, 1100 mm/s, and 0.06 mm, respectively. The energy density of this processing parameter was 76 J/mm3. In this research, the Ti‐Ta samples with four different LPBF parameters (S1–S4) were taken for further investigation, as listed in Table 4. The Image‐based method was used to analyze the formation of LPBF‐built Ti‐Ta, as shown in Figure 4. The relative den‐ sities of all samples under those four parameters were 98.76%, 99.67%, 99.98%, and 93.74%, respectively. The laser energy density was inversely proportional to v. Under the same P, h, and d, the lower scanning speed caused higher energy density and vice versa [27]. The scanning speed used for S1 was the lowest among all samples. The formation of S1 (Figure 4a) was worse than both S2 (Figure 4b) and S3 (Figure 4c). The decrease in the laser scan speed led to an increase in input energy which caused the keyhole to produce extensive material vaporization [35–37]. There were a large number of pores generated, leading to the rela‐ tive density decreasing. Very limited pores were generated in S2 and S3 samples, which indicated that the process parameters of those two samples were appropriate. The for‐ mation of S4 was the worst, as shown in Figure 4d. There were a large number of irregular pores in the sample. The scanning speed used for S4 was the highest among all samples. The input laser energy was insufficient to melt the metal powder, which led to a bad com‐ bination of the material. Thus, a great number of defects appeared in the sample.

The Ta content of S1 was 30.4 wt.% which was the highest among all samples, due to the evaporation of Ti under the condition of high input energy. The Ta content of S2 and S3 were 28.3 wt.% and 27.9 wt.%, respectively, which were similar to the designed composition. The Ta content was increased around the incompletely melted Ta particles, forming a Ta‐rich zone. It had an influence on the phase species and the crystal structure in LPBF‐ built Ti‐Ta alloy. The centers of unmelted Ta particles were taken to conduct linear EDS scanning for determining the change in Ta content. S2 and S3 were selected for testing. In Figure 7a,b, the highest Ta content was 32.8 wt.% and 36.7 wt.% in S2 and S3 respectively. The lowest Ta content was 19 wt.% and 15.4 wt.% in S2 and S3 respectively. As the line scanning results indicated, the unmelted Ta particle content was close to the design value in both S2 and S3. However, the Ta content fluctuated at different positions on the scan‐ ning line. The input energy density of S2 was higher than that of S3 during the preparation process. Therefore, more Ta was melted, and the evaporation of Ti was high, resulting in the Ta content in the matrix of S2 being higher than that of S3. Both in S2 and S3, the Ta content in some positions was more than 30 wt.% but less than 50 wt.%, suggesting the α″ phase tended to be formed instead of the β phase [11].

There were few unmelted Ta particles that ex‐ isted in S1. The laser energy was much higher than S3 which led to the molten pool having a higher temperature during the LPBF process. Thus, the Ta particles tended to gain enough energy for full melting. (a) (b) (c) Figure 5. Optical micrograph of unmelted Ta particles in the etched LPBF‐built Ti‐Ta samples.

Phase Identification of LPBF Ti‐Ta Alloy The phases and structures of the LPBF‐built Ti‐Ta samples were detected by the XRD, as shown in Figure 8. The α′, α″, and β phases were identified by XRD according to the PDF cards 03‐065‐9615 00‐52‐920, and 00‐052‐960. In Figure 8a, all the peaks of the α″ phase appeared in the XRD pattern which indicated S1 was mainly the α″ phase. The peak of β (1 1 0) overlapped with α″ (0 0 2) and β (2 1 1) did not appear, which demonstrated a small amount of β phase existed in the S1. The input energy and the temperature of the molten pool in S1 were high, which led to the intense evaporation of Ti. This decreased the content of Ti in the composition and promoted the formation of the α″ in S1. The amount of melted Ta in the Ti‐Ta matrix of S1 did not reach the minimum limit to stabilize the β phase, so the amount of β phase was very low. Meanwhile, the β phase in the S1 was also attributed to a few unmelted Ta particles. In the XRD pattern of the S2, as shown in Figure 8b, all the α′, α″, and β phases were detected. The existence of the α″ phase was distinguished from the α′ phase by the occurrence of α″ (0 2 0) and α″ (0 2 1) peaks. The energy density used for preparing S2 was lower than S1, thus the evaporation of Ti was less. Hence, the average Ta content of the matrix was lower, which promoted the for‐ mation of the α′ phase. The α′ and β phases were found in the XRD pattern of the S3, as shown in Figure 8c. The unmelted Ta particles caused component heterogeneity and seg‐ regation, resulting in the formation of the Ta rich zone, and thus the β phases tend to Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 19 (c) Materials2023,16,2208 Figure 6.

The calculated grain sizes of S1, S2, and S3 were 16.31 nm, 10.67 nm, and 20.16 nm, respectively. The EBSD and TEM tests of S1 and S3 were conducted to confirm the co‐existence of the α′, α″, and β phases. The S1 primarily contained the α″ phase, as detected in Figure 9a, which was consistent with the XRD results. The high laser energy density caused high residual thermal stress generated in the samples during the LPBF process. The preformed under‐layer was heat treated during the LPBF process which induced the formation of the annealing twin crystal due to its fast‐cooling speed. In addition, the α″ phase was ortho‐ rhombic and the lattice symmetry was lower than that of HCP (α′ phase) and BCC (β phase) [17,28], which made it easy to have the twin structure.

In sample S3, the grain size of α′ phase was 0.92–7.75 μm, and it showed the columnar morphology in the building direction. This phenomenon was because of the difference in the composition supercooling due to the various LPBF energy densities. Martensite texture was signifi‐ cantly increased, as shown in Figures 10d and 11d. The α′/α″ were formed by the solid transition of the β phase during the cooling process.

At high magnification (Figure 12f), the prior β phase was found to grow along the radial direction of the molten pool in form of a columnar grain. The grain boundary of the β phase remained at room temperature, and the fine lamellar martensite α′ phase precipi- tated inside it. The LPBF energy density of S3 was the lowest among S1, S2, and S3, and the thermal effect between layers was the weakest. Therefore, the former as-built part of the sample did not undergo further phase transformation in the subsequent LPBF printing process. Furthermore, the prior β phase did not grow up and form the large-size grain boundaries The grain morphology of the prior β phase is generally determined by the tempera- ture gradient (G) and solidification rate (R) [12,27], and the critical condition for compo- nent supercooling is expressed as the following equation, Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 where k is the partition coefficient, D is the liquid diffusivity, and ΔT0 is the temperature difference between the equilibrium liquidus line and solidus line of the alloy of composi‐ tion C0. When the G/R ratio is greater than that of the ΔT0/D, the column grain tended to form. Otherwise, the equiaxed grain tends to form. In sample S2, firstly, although the high laser energy density led to a large degree of supercooling, the alternating heat treatment affected the as‐built part of the sample during the LPBF process. Secondly, the thermal influence of each layer during the preparation process reduced the supercooling degree of the whole environment, which meant the G/R ratio was reduced. The equiaxed prior β grain was preferred to grow [27]. In S3, the applied laser energy density was low, causing the thermal effect between each as‐built layer to be little. The temperature gradient was increased which led to a high degree of supercooling per layer in the LPBF process. Higher Materials2023,16,2208 13of19 G/R led grains to grow along the epitaxy of solidification and the shape of the prior β grain tended to be columnar [27].

There are significant differences in frac‐ ture types of the two samples, as shown in Figure 14a,e,c,g. There was no shrinkage at the fracture of S2, showing the characteristics of mixed fracture. Inversely, there was obvious plastic deformation and shrinkage at the fracture of S3, indicating the characteristics of ductile fracture. As shown in Figure 14b,f, the cleavage planes and shallow dimples ex‐ isted, indicating sample S2 was dominated by brittle fracture.

Obviously, both the prior β phase grain and Ta particles at the fracture of sample S2 remained equiaxed, indi‐ cating the tensile sample suffered less deformation.

Conclusions In this study, the difference in energy density led to an influence on heat accumula‐ tion, and supercooling degree of the inner layer, resulting in the difference in composition, phase structure, and microstructure. It had a great influence on mechanical properties. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. The influences of different printing parameters on the formability of Ti‐Ta alloy were investigated. The Ta particles melted sufficiently with very high energy density but will cause a large number of pores and defects. The high‐density Ti‐Ta alloy (>99.9%) with many unmelted Ta particles was obtained by using low LPBF energy. More de‐ fects and pores were generated with very low energy density, which insufficiently melted Ti‐Ta alloy. 2. The microstructure of LPBF in the Ti‐Ta alloy was dominated by the α′ phase with very fine grains by using relatively low LPBF energy. The twin martensite α″ phase tended to generate with high laser energy. In the contrast, Ti‐Ta of α′ phase and pure Ta particles of β phase were obtained in the alloy with the low LPBF energy. The thermal effect of the printing process had a great influence on the formation of phases and morphology. 3. The tensile strength of the Ti‐Ta alloy prepared by LPBF was higher than that of the as‐cast sample. It was also higher than the previously reported LPBF Ti‐Ta alloy. The sample prepared with 76 J/mm3 LPBF energy density showed a tensile strength of 771 MPa and a fracture elongation of 31%, which had outstanding ductility and mod‐ erate strength. The sample prepared with 381 J/mm3 showed a tensile strength of 1076 MPa, and a fracture elongation of 7.5%, which had excellent strength. The mechanical Materials2023,16,2208 17of19 4.

Most LPBF studies use commercial pre-alloyed powders and less attention has Laser powder bed fusion been given to new alloy design for LPBF. Physical mixing of powders with different chemistries can be an Duplex stainless steel effective way to access new alloy compositions for LPBF without the need for custom pre-alloyed powders. In this Compositional distribution work, a previously published model to describe the chemical distribution of LPBF material from mixed powders Remelting is extended to the process of remelting and is quantitatively compared with experiment. A mix of Ni and stainless steel powders is used to assess the effect of remelting on the chemical homogeneity and the model is shown to agree well with experiment once evaporation of selected species and changes in melt pool size during remelting are incorporated. Strategies to improve the chemical homogeneity of prints from mixed powders are discussed. Remelting is one approach but the chemical homogeneity improves only marginally after three remelts. The critical role of the melt pool size compared to the minority powder particle spacing is emphasised. Finally, an example of using spatially controlled chemical homogeneity to create architectured materials using LPBF is shown. 1. Introduction available powders (elemental, or pre-alloyed, or a combination) so that the overall composition matches the desired new composition.

It shows excellent agreement with sitions of the laser, e.g. [66]. The general observations are that chemical the composition calculated from the manufacturer reported powder homogeneity can be improved by decreasing the laser scan speed (e.g. compositions. The powder mixture was prepared by rotating PE bottles [10,38,48]), increasing the laser energy (e.g. [14,38,58]), or by containing the mixed powder for 48 h on a tube roller. remelting [5,6,43]. These efforts are a reflection of the community asking how the chemical homogeneity can be controlled, either through 2.2. Printing process control, or through the preparation of the powder mixtures. Li et al. [66] recently presented a model to describe the probability An M-Lab Cusing R LPBF machine (Concept Laser) with a Nd:YAG distribution for the chemical homogeneity in the as-built state using laser, maximum power of 100 W and 50 µm spot size, was used for the LPBF of mixed powders.

Opti- distribution in the starting state and full chemical mixing in the melt mised parameters (ie. porosity < 0.2%) for printing included a 90 W pool (i.e. it assumes the powders dissolve in the melt pool). Whilst these laser power, 150 mm/s laser scan speed, hatch spacing of 120 µm and 15 authors were interested in taking advantage of deliberate chemical µm layer thickness. A remelting strategy, which consisted of multiple heterogeneity in the as built state, and other authors have also recently laser passes before a new layer of powder is applied (Fig. 1) was highlighted the interest in deliberately heterogeneous materials [23,34], investigated as a tool to improve the chemical homogeneity of mixed the model presented was able to predict the chemical heterogeneity as a powder prints. Two geometric variations of remelting were examined. function of both laser scan speed and scan line overlap. The key physical The first strategy consisted of a 90◦ rotation between remelting laser quantity being varied by changes in the processing was the melt pool scans. A second remelting scan pattern was explored with a 67◦rotation size, and the importance of this quantity for chemical mixing and the between layers, ensuring no direct overlap in laser scan tracks would resulting homogeneity has also been highlighted by other authors [38, occur during subsequent remelting scans. 58]. Better chemical mixing is obtained with bigger melt pool sizes Zero remelt refers to initial powder melting for material consolida- because the larger melt pool size includes more powder and as the tion (i.e. the usual additive manufacturing consolidation process) and volume of powder being melted increases, it approaches a better the maximum number of remelts attempted was six. All prints were approximation to the overall powder chemistry. However, there are performed with a nitrogen atmosphere and oxygen content below 0.2%. limits to the melt pool sizes that can be accessed in practice, either due to 10mm side length cubes, obtained using the 90◦rotation remelting power constraints of the laser, or constraints around printing defect strategy, and cylinders with a size of ϕ 10mm×10mm, obtained using control. Remelting steps have been shown to improve the homogeneity the 67◦ rotation remelting strategy, were used for microstructural and of the local chemistries found in builds made from mixed powders [5,6, chemical characterisation. 43], but there is currently no guidance on what remelting strategies should be used. The objective of this contribution is to fill that gap in knowledge. 2.3. Microstructural characterisation In this work, we extend the model presented by Li et al.

Strategies to obtain chemically homogeneous builds using Another method to improve the chemical homogeneity in the as-built mixed powders state obtained from mixed powders is to reduce the minority particle spacing in the starting powder mixture. For a given overall powder Previously, we have presented a model to predict the chemistry mixture composition, this is achieved by reducing the minority powder distribution in a mixed powder build [66]. This has now been extended particle size (i.e. there must be more particles, spaced closer together, to to the case of remelting. This model should be capable of identifying the achieve the same composition as a few, larger, further spaced particles). best strategies to minimise chemical heterogeneity for those interested The extreme case of this strategy is ‘satelliting’ where very small mi- in using mixed powders to examine new alloy compositions in LPBF. nority particles are attached to the majority powder particles.

A danger with reducing the minority powder particle size compared These problems have already been observed many times when trying to to the majority powder particle size, is the risk of settling or clumping of in-situ alloy using refractory additions such as Mo, Nb, Ta [3–8,14,25, the minority powder, and therefore moving away from the random 27–32], etc. Remelting may assist by providing more time for dissolution powder representation which will lead to more chemical heterogeneity. of these high melting point powders but avoiding them in the first place Satelliting solves this problem by having the minority powder particles is an obvious first strategy. attached to the major powder particles.

There are two reasons for this transition – a) not been discussed in much depth yet in the literature. Since remelting remelting narrows the probability distribution of the chemistry and can be spatially controlled and it can be used to modify the probability shifts a larger fraction of the microstructure above the critical Ni content distribution of the local chemistry, and the phases that form during to trigger FCC formation from the liquid during solidification [66], and 12 H.

Ti25Ta shows promise as a biomedical implant alloy, due to its Titanium high strength to elastic modulus ratio. However, the fatigue response of L-PBF Ti25Ta is yet unknown and un- Laser powder bed fusion derstanding fatigue behaviour is crucial for cyclically loaded implants. Low-cycle fatigue The Ti25Ta alloy was produced employing single melt and remelt scanning strategies. It was shown that the remelt strategy had a positive effect on reducing the amount of remaining partially melted Ta particles from 2.07 ±0.01 vol % to 0.22 ±0.01 vol % while only slightly increasing the porosity from 0.15 ±0.01 vol % to 0.37 ± 0.01 vol %. Furthermore, it was found that the remelt strategy resulted in alloy strengthening and a randomised orientation of the α′lath microstructure. Machined fatigue samples were tested in the low-cycle fatigue regime under strain-controlled conditions. The alloy demonstrated a superior yield stress normalised fatigue performance compared with commercially pure (CP) Ti, and Ti–6Al–4V ELI, and was second only to pure Ta. However, the Ti25Ta L-PBF material retains less than half the elastic modulus of all the compared materials. The remelt samples showed an increased stress response due to their higher strength and an increased elastic modulus, however a reduced number of cycles to failure. This was attributed to reduced ductility and increased crack propagation rate. It is believed that remelt scan parameter optimisation can further enhance the performance of this alloy. 1.

This discrepancy may be attributed to the method of structure, ultimately decreasing the elastic modulus. However, at 30 wt testing used. Whilst ultrasonic modulus testing is generally perceived as % Ta the elastic modulus once again increases. For such alloys, presence the more accurate method of modulus measurement [22], the method of the α′′ phase, as well as further phases such as ω phase, have been may have been effected by the inhomogeneity of the material with revealed [74].

However, Fig. 4 nium alloys [77–80]. shows that the remelt scan results in a decrease in the number of cycles The initial parameter study for mixed powder Ti25Ta showed no to failure for a given strain amplitude. This is likely due to a combination increase in porosity when the remelt scan was applied, for identical of several factors including; ductility, porosity, residual stress and printing parameters [35]. However, it must be noted that the initial dislocation density. parameter study used optical microscopy to measure the porosity, which Whilst comparing the factors which contribute to fatigue failure, it is less reliable than Micro-CT observations. Generally, literature studies must be considered that the strain amplitudes used in this study fall show that a remelt scan increases part density when identical scanning mainly into the LCF regime. The LCF performance tends to be dominated parameters are used for the single scan and the remelt scan [45,47,48, by crack propagation life, whilst (very) high-cycle fatigue performance 52,54,57,81,82]. For these studies, it is likely that the single melt tends to be dominated by crack initiation life [12,84]. Whilst micro- scanning conditions bordered on a lower energy density. As a result, a structural features can affect fatigue performance to different degrees in single scan may result in porosity due to insufficient melting, and the either regime, the failure of the samples in the present study is likely remelt scan induces liquid flow a second time to fill in previous defects. attributed to crack propagation, which is highly dependent on material When scanning parameters differ between the single and remelt ductility. scans, it is shown that the part density can decrease, particularly if the It was shown in previous studies [35] that under quasi-static tensile energy density of the remelt scan is raised [45,55,82]. Higher energy loading the remelt samples exhibited a 28% increase in material yield density of the remelt scan can lead to vaporisation, despite the reduced strength, however, a 56% reduction in elongation to fracture. A decrease laser absorption. It is hypothesised that the temperature of the melt pool in ductility leads to an increase in notch sensitivity [3], as well as faster rises as heat cannot be conducted quickly enough away from the melting crack propagation [2], due to a reduced zone of plastic deformation in zone facilitating material vaporisation. This effect may be seen primarily front of the crack tip. The reduced ductility is hence a severe contrib- in titanium alloys due the low thermal conductivity of titanium (21.9 W uting factor to the inferior performance of the remelt samples at all (m K) -1) compared with other commonly AM metals such as aluminium strain amplitudes.

Therefore, a second application of the laser with the same parameters Although the samples were tested in the LCF regime, the effect of would likely compound the porosity. The optimal parameters chosen in porosity and partially melted Ta particles acting as crack initiation sites Ref. [35] were on the cusp of the transition to keyhole formation and a must still be considered. The remelt scan reduces the number of slight variation to the powder composition or to the laser power, may remaining Ta particles, however, at the same slightly increases the pore have caused a shift in energy density. concentration, as shown in Fig. 3. Reducing the number of remaining Ta particles could increase fatigue performance, however, any improve- ment is possibly concealed by the detrimental effect of the increased porosity. The fractography analysis, Fig. 5, shows that in all samples the 7 E.G. Brodie et al. M a t e r i a l s S c i e n c e & E n g i n e e r i n g A 798(2020)140228 fatigue cracks initiate at pores and none at remaining Ta particles. Hence, the reduced amount of Ta particles in the remelt sample has a negligible effect on the fatigue life. Additionally, the number count increase in pores caused by the remelt scan (317 pores) is less than the decreased number count of Ta particles (1326 Ta particles). The overall number of crack initiation sites is hence decreased by the remelt scan. However, when comparing the shape and size of these features, the Ta particles show an average par- ticle diameter of 22 μm, larger than that of the pores, 15 μm. Larger defects tend to be most detrimental to fatigue life [85,86], however the cohesion between the Ta particles and the matrix result in them being less critical defects. The porosity increase caused by the remelt scan had little effect on the fatigue life, likely due to the porosity size distribution. Romano et al. [85,86] have shown that surface defects above 120 μm in diameter significantly alter the relationship between pore size and fa- tigue life. The maximum pore diameter in the single melt sample was 32 μm, whilst that of the remelt sample was 40 μm. This minor increase in the maximum pore size was shown to have negligible effect on the fa- tigue performance and agrees well with the studies conducted by Fig. 7.

At 0.65% strain amplitude the single melt sample stress response (423 MPa) was much closer to its yield strength (426 ± ised stress for any given number of cycles to failure (Fig. 7). The Ti25Ta 15 MPa) [35] than the remelt scan sample (498 MPa and 545 ±9 MPa single melt is only outperformed by pure Ta and shows superior prop- erties to CP Ti. This can be attributed to the solid solution strengthening [35], respectively). This seems to be contradictory at first glance, of the α′Ti by Ta atoms, without largely reducing ductility. However, the however, could indicate a difference in dislocation density. If the remelt pure Ta and CP Ti both display almost twice the elastic modulus of the samples are characterised by a higher dislocation density, dislocation Ti25Ta alloy. This large reduction in elastic modulus, without sacrificing annihilation may be enhanced during cyclic loading, resulting in pro- fatigue performance, reveals the Ti25Ta single melt material as a very nounced softening. Peak broadening in XRD analysis was used to promising material for implant applications. The remelt scan material attempt the quantification of residual stress and dislocation density, also performs well, however, is outperformed by the single melt material however, no difference in peak broadening could be quantified between in this examination, due to the factors discussed in section 4.3. the single and remelt conditions.
